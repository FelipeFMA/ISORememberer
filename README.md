# ISORememberer

A simple shell script that reminds you to download the new Arch Linux ISO on the first day of each month.

## Overview

This script checks if today is the first day of the month, and if so, displays a reminder message to download the new Arch Linux ISO.

## Usage

Add this to your shell configuration file (like `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `config.fish`) to get reminded every time you open a new terminal on the first day of the month.

## Why?

This tool helps me to remember to download and seed the latest ISO each month.
